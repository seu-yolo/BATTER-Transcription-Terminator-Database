# v0.3 public asset handoff

This is the shortest maintainer sequence for handing the registered public
objects (browser assets plus API-facing release files) to an external HTTPS
object store. The repository does not implement an uploader and does not
contain credentials. The upload and immutable-revision remote audit below are
complete for the current handoff; database import and production deployment
remain separate gates.

## Verified handoff (2026-08-22)

- The tracked browser inventory has 105 rows spanning 19 unique assemblies.
- The planned materialized bundle has 211 asset rows. The preparation policy
  selects all 164 rows with `is_public=true` and
  `redistribution_status=verified_redistributable`, and excludes 47 private or
  external rows. The 77 inventory rows with the same public status are only a
  browser provenance cross-check; they are not the complete upload set.
- The current local GFF/FAI materialization contains 95,437 genes and keeps
  `endpoint_gene_context` at zero.
- The public dataset is [seu-yolo/BTED-v0.3-assets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/seu-yolo/BTED-v0.3-assets).
- The immutable audited revision is
  `d12190e434057edaf2c2bdbf19132f1e41873c38`; all URLs use
  `https://huggingface.co/datasets/seu-yolo/BTED-v0.3-assets/resolve/d12190e434057edaf2c2bdbf19132f1e41873c38`.
- The 164 public objects total 126,280,212 bytes. All 164 passed HEAD `200`
  with matching `Content-Length` and a single-byte Range `206` with the
  registered `Content-Range` and one returned byte.
- The generated evidence is committed at
  `data/registry/remote_asset_audit.v0.2.0-hf.json` with SHA-256
  `3c4fed76dbd996164229605bc32eb52afed68c94a56bfb4233df2e6f492f46e0`.
- The verified bundle's manifest SHA-256 is
  `849876269dd1827014f1a75daacd2fdf418c642eb96fd39984d58641913f2264`.
  The final verified bundle itself is a local temporary handoff artifact and
  is intentionally not committed.

The JSON evidence keeps `release_version` as `v0.2.0`: the asset handoff
verifies the current canonical release and does not publish a `v0.3.0` data
release.

## Maintainer sequence

1. Materialize the release with the tracked browser inventory, then prepare the
   exact object set from its `assets.jsonl`. The output directory must be new or
   empty; the command verifies local byte size and SHA-256 before copying
   anything. It resolves browser paths from the frozen JBrowse bundle and
   canonical `records/` paths from the release root.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/import_bted_v03.py materialize \
     --release-root data/public/v0.2.0 \
     --repo-root . \
     --output-dir /path/to/bted-v03-staging-with-browser \
     --asset-origin-base https://huggingface.co/datasets/seu-yolo/BTED-v0.3-assets/resolve/d12190e434057edaf2c2bdbf19132f1e41873c38 \
     --generated-at-utc 2026-08-22T00:00:00Z \
     --jbrowse-asset-inventory data/registry/jbrowse_assets.v0.2.0.tsv \
     --jbrowse-bundle-root /path/to/BTED-v0.2.0-jbrowse
   ```

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/prepare_v03_public_asset_objects.py \
     --materialized-bundle /path/to/bted-v03-staging-with-browser \
     --inventory data/registry/jbrowse_assets.v0.2.0.tsv \
     --jbrowse-bundle /path/to/BTED-v0.2.0-jbrowse \
     --release-root data/public/v0.2.0 \
     --output-dir /path/to/bted-v03-public-objects
   ```

   This produces `ASSET_OBJECTS.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and the 164-object
   `object_path` tree. `ASSET_OBJECTS.json` is selected from the materialized
   211-row asset table and records `asset_id`, `object_path`, `byte_size`, and
   `sha256` for every object. `--manifest-only` is useful for a dry preparation
   check; it does not create upload payload files.

2. Upload the copied object tree with the project-approved external/manual
   uploader. Preserve every `object_path` exactly, use the explicit immutable
   HTTPS origin base that will be given to the audit command, and do not upload
   the 47 excluded objects. The 164-object tree plus
   `ASSET_OBJECTS.json`/`SHA256SUMS.txt` has been uploaded to the dataset above;
   the repository's automatically generated `.gitattributes` is unrelated
   metadata.

3. Audit the remote objects with one HEAD and one single-byte Range request per
   registered object. The auditor constructs URLs only from `object_path` and
   the explicit HTTPS origin; it does not accept arbitrary manifest URLs,
   retry, cache, upload, or hash full remote files.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/audit_v03_remote_assets.py \
     --asset-objects /path/to/bted-v03-public-objects/ASSET_OBJECTS.json \
     --origin-base https://huggingface.co/datasets/seu-yolo/BTED-v0.3-assets/resolve/d12190e434057edaf2c2bdbf19132f1e41873c38 \
     --output /path/to/bted-v03-public-objects/REMOTE_ASSET_AUDIT.json
   ```

   A successful full audit reports 164/164 objects. Each row must have the
   registered size and SHA-256, HEAD `200` with matching `Content-Length`,
   Range `206`, `Content-Range: bytes 0-0/<size>`, one returned byte, and
   `supports_range=true`/`ok=true`. A non-zero exit still writes the audit
   report; fix the external object and rerun the audit.

   The 77 browser rows remain visible in the preparation manifest as an
   inventory cross-check; the other 87 public rows are canonical metadata,
   checksums, endpoint/annotation files and related small API assets selected by
   the same materialized table.

4. Apply the completed 164-object report to a `planned_not_verified` materialized bundle
   in a new output directory. This step is offline: it compares every required
   public asset's `asset_id`, `object_path`, byte size and SHA-256, and
   requires recorded HEAD `200` plus Range `206` before setting
   `supports_range=true`.

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/apply_v03_remote_asset_audit.py \
     --bundle-dir /path/to/bted-v03-staging-with-browser \
     --remote-audit /path/to/bted-v03-public-objects/REMOTE_ASSET_AUDIT.json \
     --jbrowse-asset-inventory data/registry/jbrowse_assets.v0.2.0.tsv \
     --output-dir /path/to/bted-v03-verified-bundle
   ```

   The command refuses an incomplete or mismatched report. It derives the
   required set from every materialized row with `is_public=true` and
   `redistribution_status=verified_redistributable` (currently 164); the tracked
   inventory separately verifies the 77-object browser subset. It marks the
   origin `verified` only when all 164 required assets pass; the 47
   `external_link_only`/private assets remain `supports_range=false`. It then
   rebuilds bundle checksums and runs the existing offline bundle verifier.
   This still does not write PostgreSQL or perform promotion. The pinned
   revision bundle verified in this handoff has `asset_origin_status=verified`;
   an earlier bundle using mutable `resolve/main` is superseded and must not be
   used as the final handoff.

## Remaining gates

- Generate and import the verified bundle into the Cloudflare D1 preview projection;
  the current local D1 smoke is documented in [`deployment.md`](deployment.md). This
  remains a preview projection, not a PostgreSQL promotion or a new data release.
- Complete the Cloudflare remote deployment only after a human performs the short
  `npx wrangler login` step; the non-interactive `wrangler whoami` check is currently
  unauthenticated, so no remote D1 or Worker URL exists in this handoff.
- Render/Neon/Vercel are future/alternative deployment paths for the retained
  FastAPI/PostgreSQL/Next.js code and are intentionally not part of this route.
- Package and separately accept the lightweight JBrowse shell/configuration.
- Define and review the `endpoint_gene_context` algorithm; it remains zero.

The audit script's injected transport and focused tests are for offline code
verification only. The committed report above is the real pinned-origin
evidence; it is not a database promotion or a production deployment.
